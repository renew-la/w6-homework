# Week 6: JS Functions and Arrays Homework

There are three questions this week. You will need to write functions and use arrays to come up with your solutions. 

The index.html file contains the questions and directions. Open up the file in your web browser. You do not need to edit the code on this file.
The exercises.js file is where you will be doing your homework. Declare variables, write functions, and call those functions in order to create the answer statements.

If you are stuck, don't worry - Google is your best friend! If you still can't find what you are looking for, please reach out to us on Slack if you have any questions!
