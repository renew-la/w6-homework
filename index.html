    <h3>The Fortune Teller: With Functions!</h3>
    <p>Let's turn one of last week's exercises into a function.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write a function named <code>tellFortune</code> that:
        <ul>
          <li>takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.</li>
          <li>outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <div>
    <h3>What number is bigger?</h3>
    <p>Write a function that compares two numbers and returns the larger one. Be sure to try it out with some different numbers. Bonus: add error messages if the numbers are equal or cannot be compared.</p>
    <p>Don't forget to test it!</p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <div>
    <h3>Top Choice</h3>
    <p>Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, presidents, whatever). For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."</p>

    <p>Bonus: Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd choice", "My 3rd choice", picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice">The method slice</a> might be helpful here.</p>
